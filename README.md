# Bank_Management_System

## A simple project which uses Python and MySQL's interface to do the following:

  • Create a new user and add a Primary Key for identification

  • Create a seperate table for that particular user using their unique ID and storing their transactions
  
  • Delete a user's data
  
  • Update certain values regarding the user in the main table
  
  • Give option to the user to create a new table in case the given one doesn't exist
  
  • Fetch entries regarding a user, order them and ability to select only certain data-types to be shown
  
  • Create backup of a table's data in a user specified binary file
  
  • Add/Remove money from user's account, and add a latest timestamp while doing so
  
  • Also update the main table balance if the user-specific table is modified
  
  • Some more miscellaneous stuff
